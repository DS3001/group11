    "### Research Question 2 \n",
    "One of the general topics this research project aimed to explore is what is the relationship between age and general happiness/satisfaction. The following are questions that explored this general theme: what age are people happiest, what age are people most financially satisfied, and what age are people most satisfied with their job. The project employed box plots to explore these questions and analyze the relationship between age and different forms of satisfaction. This analysis assesses the main findings, the statistical support for conclusions, the research strategy, and the interpretation of results.\n",

    "Data used for this project was sourced from the General Social Survey (GSS), a public opinion survey which has been administered annually or biennially in the U.S. starting in 1972. It is important to note that according to the GSS 2022 release notes:\n",

    "\"Changes in opinions, attitudes, and behaviors observed in 2021 and 2022 relative to historical trends may be due to actual change in concept over time and/or may have resulted from methodological changes made to the survey methodology during the COVID-19 global pandemic. Research and interpretation done using the 2021 and 2022 GSS data should take extra care to ensure the analysis reflects actual changes in public opinion and is not unduly influenced by the change in data collection methods.

Additionally, the research does not consider potential confounding variables that may affect satisfaction levels, such as social and economic factors.\n",
    "To build upon this research, it is essential to investigate the factors causing unhappiness, especially among younger individuals. Exploring the role of loneliness, economic instability, and career prospects in happiness and life satisfaction could be a valuable extension of this project. Additionally, examining how external factors, such as societal changes or economic conditions, influence these age-satisfaction relationships would provide a more comprehensive understanding. "
